# üß† Project 01 ‚Äì Binary Classification | PPGEEC2318

This repository contains the implementation of **Project 01 - Binary Classification**, developed for the course **PPGEEC2318 - Machine Learning**, instructed by Professor **Ivanovitch Medeiros**.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple **binary classification model** using **PyTorch**. The classification task is based on the "Admission Prediction" problem, where we use a dataset containing applicants‚Äô profiles and attempt to predict whether each applicant was admitted or not.

Throughout this project, we will:

- Explore and preprocess the dataset;
- Build and train a neural network for binary classification;
- Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance;
- Document our findings and results clearly.

This project aims to provide a hands-on introduction to binary classification using PyTorch and to reinforce fundamental machine learning concepts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
